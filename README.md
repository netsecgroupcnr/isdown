# isdown

isDown is a web service for system administrators, allowing them to check the availability of their servers

### Introduction ###

isDown gives you the ability to use a third-party for checking if your web service is down or not.
Moreover, it allows you to specify a custom expiration timeout, retrieve information in JSON or XML formats, etc.

The isDown ecosystem should not be considered a standalone server on the Internet.
Instead, it is an effective [federated network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_(information_technology)).
From Wikipedia, a federated network is composed by "multiple computing and/or network providers agreeing upon standards of operation in a collective fashion". 
In particular, you can install isDown on your own server and connect to other existing and working similar servers.

### Preliminary requirements ###
